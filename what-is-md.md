### MarkDown text format for docs.

Markdown was initially created by John Gruber (of Daring Fireball) as a simple way for non-programming types to write in an easy-to-read format that could be converted directly into HTML.

For example, to create a header you use hashtags. So, "# HEADLINE" is a large header. "## HEADLINE" would be a little smaller, "### HEADLINE" would be smaller still.

Want to make a bulleted list? Just type in a "-" "+" or "*" before any item and the list is created automatically.
